          He believes that everyone should be able to take part in and benefit

            The capability to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of regional
            and country programs amidst uncertainty characterized by changing
            circumstances, contexts, and trends.
          </li>

          <li>
            Developing and implementing approaches for coordination and the
            management of complex inter-organizational relationships,
            acknowledging diversity, and the leadership of multi-cultural teams.

          firm believer in hard work and creative instincts, this is one woman
          to watch out for.

  //         Ashish was born into a family of filmmakers in Orissa and grew up
  //         surrounded by celluloid cans and chemicals. He began experimenting
  //         with various early photography techniques after earning a B.F.A. in
  //         sculpture from Shantiniketan, where he was introduced to the history
  //         of art and photography. He studied wet plate collodion glass
  //         Negatives, a mid-eighteenth-century photographic process. He only
  //         shoots film and alternate processes.
