        TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading.
        Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has
        grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual
        TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak
        for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available,
        free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall,
        Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe
        Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.

        Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks
        are posted daily; TED Translators, which provides subtitles and
        interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers
        worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established The

        with the potential to create change at thrilling scale; TEDx, which
        supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized
        TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping

        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local,
        self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
        experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine
        to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized
        events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.
        The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
        individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and
        regulations.)
